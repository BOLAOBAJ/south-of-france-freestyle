Shawty i dunno what you want from me
But me already know what i want from you
Give me your hands lemme take you home
Surely im gon give you all you need
I dont give a fuck you can bring your friends
We gon party hard in the south of france
We can take it fast we can take it slow
You aint got to fear girl im in control
Let it be known to the whole wide world
Me and you gon ride till the wheels fall off
We gon show the world what we do for love 
Come into my arms dont be acting tough
